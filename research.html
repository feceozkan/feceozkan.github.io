                Starting from infancy, we are inundated by information from different sources. How
                do we choose which information to attend to and which source to trust? How do we
                interpret the information we receive? How do we revise what we believe? How do we
                justify our beliefs? What kind of biases do we show when seeking and using
                information? Are there cross-cultural differences in the development of social
                learning and reasoning? These questions constitute the focus of my research
                interests, whose overarching theme is the development of human social learning and
                reasoning.

                    Selective Social Learning and Mental State Inferences
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base">
                    In this line of research, I examine children’s and adults’ selective epistemic
                    trust and inferences about testimony. I investigate the epistemic and social
                    cues (e.g., predictability, similarity) they use to infer information
                    reliability. I am also interested in children’s inferences about evaluative
                    information (e.g., “It’s good!”) as well as non-evaluative information (e.g.,
                    “Clouds fill with water”). I conduct research aiming to understand how children
                    and adults make speaker-specific inferences about a person’s ambiguous
                    evaluations (e.g., “It’s okay!”) using that person’s past comments. For example,
                    when two people say, “It’s okay”, they might not correspond to similar levels of
                    liking. When and how do we understand that each person is a different indicator?

                    Cross-linguistic Differences in Children’s Social Learning and Reasoning
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base">
                    This line of work focuses on whether and how speakers of different languages
                    differ in their argumentation and belief revision. For example, in Turkish, it
                    is grammatically obligatory to express how information was acquired (whether the
                    speaker is reporting direct observation or hearsay), while it is not obligatory
                    in English. I investigate whether this type of linguistic cues facilitates young
                    children’s reasoning. In two projects, we examined how 3- and 5-year-old
                    Turkish-speaking and English-speaking children talk about the reliability of the
                    information they received to convince someone, i.e., metatalk, and revise their
                    existing beliefs depending on the reliability of the counterevidence. We found
                    that children as young as three years of age produce metatalk to justify their
                    beliefs and revise their own beliefs based on the reliability of the information
                    offered to them. Although Turkish-speaking children had advantages in justifying
                    their beliefs, both linguistic groups showed equal performance in revising their
                    beliefs.

                    Biases in Information Seeking and Reasoning
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base">
                    Are we rational learners seeking the truth? In this line of research, I examine
                    the biases we have in information seeking and argumentation. For example, we
                    tend to seek and use more information in favor of our perspective than those
                    against it, i.e., confirmation/myside bias. I investigate whether the presence
                    of this bias and other biases, e.g., positivity bias, depends on the aim of the
                    information search and the presence of a conflicting perspective. I explore
                    whether and how these tendencies change across the lifespan by conducting
                    studies with 5- to 55-year-olds. I am interested in the theories of reasoning
                    and argumentation; thus, in addition to providing evidence for the empirical
                    research questions I have, I also try to test the claims of the existing
                    theories.
